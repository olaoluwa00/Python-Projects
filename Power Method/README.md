# Linear Algebra: Power Method

This question was modified from a tutorial sheet question for the second year of Oxford University's undergraduate engineering course. The task was to "implement the power method to compute the dominant eigenvector of a real symmetric matrix . Your method should accept a square symmetric matrix of any size, so make sure to test it appropriately (e.g. with random inputs)."

This code was tested on an example given in the lecture notes: a 2x2 matrix with entries -1, 2, 2, 2, and an initial estimate with entries 1, 1.

I also plotted curves to show how quickly the estimated of the associated eigenvalue converges by comparing the magnitude ratio and Rayleigh quotient to the true value.
